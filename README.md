# Optimizing-Profit-Lindas-Lustfyllda-Courier---Haulage
From the Lindas Lustfyllda family of brands!

## I developed an algorithm!!
### This is what it does step by step:
1. Receive new, never seen before packages.
2. Sort the packages in order of profit, weight, and how long the deadline is overdue.
Assume that we determine priority by profit / weight.
3. Fill all the vans with packages in order of priority as determined in step 2.
4. Optimize the formula if there were any previous packagings, use the mean formula of all the previous packagings.
5. If the formula was optimized, let us know how much profit we gained compared to the raw, unoptimized formula.
6. Do a grid search to decide what the best formula for these packages would have been.
7. Calculate and remember the mean of the best formula for these packages and any potential previous packagings that took place.
8. If a large amount of previously calculated means are near this mean, assume we have found the best formula, so stop learning.
